    - Rename Getopt::EX::autocolor to Getopt::EX::termcolor.

      App::sdif already have -Mautocolor module.  When upgrading them
      to use Getopt::EX module, there should be conflict with previously
      installed autocolor.pm under the command library.  So I decided to
      change the name.
